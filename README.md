# Apple-Foundation-Program

Gymzone is an application for managing the workout plan during gym sessions. Its initial iOS version was developed with a team during the Apple Foundation Program attended in February 2023 at the University of Salerno (http://www.applefoundationprogram.unisa.it). Subsequently, a standalone version was developed for WatchOS as a peronal project for the undergraduate thesis.

In this repository, you'll find: 
- The complete application developed in SwiftUI;
- The thesis abstracts (in Italian);
- The full thesis (in Italian).
